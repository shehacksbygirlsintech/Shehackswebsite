      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">She Hacks is an all-female and non-binary hackathon aimed at bridging the gender gap in the field of technology. We were frustrated with the current gender imbalance and so made it our mission is to inspire and encourage more young women to explore the opportunities in tech, regardless of their programming experience.

We run this event to inspire, empower and unite girls to pursue their passion and interests in the technological industry, whilst allowing them to discover the exciting opportunities the vast technology field has to offer!

We're excited to announce that SheHacks is back for another inspiring event in 2024, scheduled to take place on the 24th and 25th of February. The event is filled with activities designed to foster a collaborative and educational environment. 
​
SheHacks requires no programming experience and is a great way to gain coding experience, meet industry professionals, and meet like-minded people! We hope to see you there!

      <h5 class="oswald-quote">"Women no longer have an 'if I can' mindset. Now it's more about 'how I can'–be in tech, start something in tech, fund something in tech. That shift is exciting! And it happened because we created a network where we show, daily, that women are innovating."</h5>
